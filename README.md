# Config for RatRig V-Core 3

This is my custom config for my ratrig 3d printer, including an make & flash for a STM32_Mini12864 display controller & Fysect spider board.
For flashing the spider, it will automaticaly enter flashing mode, for the STM32_Mini12864 you need to jumb BOOT0, header with 2 pins.
